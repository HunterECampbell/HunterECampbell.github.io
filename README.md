All directories except "www" were personal projects that I made based off of the things I learned in Codecademy.

Directory "www" is a Dungeons & Dragons Character tracking app, made in Vue.js, called "Character Bag".

To access any of these files/projects, use this link as a template: hunterecampell.github.io/path/to/project
